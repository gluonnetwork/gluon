# Outline

1. Gluon plasma starts with a known zero state where all balances are zero.
2. Deposits to the main chain of an asset by user increase the userâ€™s asset balance on the plasma sidechain by a corresponding amount.
3. Withdrawing funds from the plasma sidechain decrease the balance on the sidechain and enables withdrawal on the main chain.
4. Transfer of assets (trading) between users on the plasma sidechain require matching signed orders of the users, countersigned by the operator.
5. All state changes require accompanying witnesses. Any invalid witness can be used to halt the plasma sidechain and let users withdraw at leisure.
6. In the event of data unavailability, participants can vote to halt the sidechain,enabling users to withdraw on the main chain at leisure.
